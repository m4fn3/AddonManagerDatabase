  "description": "Pine\n\nIt is pretty much just a green theme, what else can I say! The colors were taken from a friends JB setup and I might also make a light mode variant some time soon when I feel like it, it will also have a different color scheme. This theme will probably be more appealing to some and some not so much, but anyways I hope you like it!\n\n- Does not work on light mode right now\n\n__Download:__\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792901931341053983/1057064282824650752/Pine.json",
