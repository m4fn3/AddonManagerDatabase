Emoji that you would normally be unable to send are unaffected, while external emoji are converted to image links. (Note: if you try to use external emojis in the middle of other text, the link will be visible. This also cannot support adding external emoji as reactions.)\n\n*Inspired and influenced by https://github.com/luimu64/nitro-spoof*\n\nTo send Nitro stickers for free, use FakeSticker: https://discord.com/channels/950850315601711176/961782195767365732/1099011286328692736\n\nDownload: https://fifithebulldog.github.io/enmity-addons-store/plugins/Freemoji.js\nSource: https://github.com/FifiTheBulldog/enmity-plugins/tree/master/Freemoji\nStore: https://fifithebulldog.github.io/enmity-addons-store/",
