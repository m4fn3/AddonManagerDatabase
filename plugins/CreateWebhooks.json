This adds a Create button (âž•) to the navigation bar of the webhooks overview and erases the \"For now, webhooks can only be created on desktop\" text that you see when there are no webhooks.\n\n*Some improvements, such as a better + button, are planned for after the Enmity rewrite comes out.*\n\nDownload: https://fifithebulldog.github.io/enmity-addons-store/plugins/CreateWebhooks.js\nSource: https://github.com/FifiTheBulldog/enmity-plugins/tree/master/CreateWebhooks\nStore: https://fifithebulldog.github.io/enmity-addons-store",
