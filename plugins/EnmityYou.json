Previews for this plugin are provided below.\n\n(*Notes:*\n*- You may need to disable the new Tabs UI to install the plugin, after which point you should be able to enable it again.*\n*- If you experience any crashes when attempting to open the new YouTab, please restart your client and try again.*\n*- If you're on an older alpha, aka any Discord version under 180, please do* *not* *use this. It will not work.*)\n\nDownload: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acquitelol/enmity-you/mistress/dist/EnmityYou.js\nSource: https://github.com/acquitelol/enmity-you",
