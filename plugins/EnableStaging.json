  "description": "EnableStaging\n\nThis plugin is identical to <@696828906191454221>'s EnableStaging, except it adds a failsafe to prevent crashes. This plugin (should) never cause crashes anymore. Please note that if the current user takes too long to initialize you may have your TabsV2/AMOLED disabled and will need to re-enable it.\n\nDownload: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acquitelol/EnableStaging/mistress/dist/EnableStaging.js\nSource: https://github.com/acquitelol/EnableStaging/tree/mistress",
